EDGAR SEC DB Schema
===================

This document gives a brief description about all tables and fields in the database generated by the `build_secdb.py` script.

DB Tables
---------

The metadata for each EDGAR filing is stored as a separate row in the `filings` tables. The actual data is also stored as a separate row in the `balance_sheet`, `income_statement`, `cashflow_statement` and `ratios` tables. The `accessionNumber` is used as a primary key for each EDGAR filing and links all of these tables together. The `ticker` table enables client applications to provide search functionality by a stock ticker symbol. The `facts` table contains the actual XBRL fact values as reported in the filing.

### TABLE tickers
The `tickers` table provides a way to find the company's CIK number from a ticker symbol. Each row maps exactly one ticker symbol to a CIK number.

|name | type | description |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| symbol | VARCHAR(10) | A company's ticker symbol |
| cikNumber | INTEGER	| A company's CIK number |

### TABLE filings
The `filings` table contains meta-information about each filing. Each row contains the meta-information for exactly one filing (quarterly or annual report). The primary key is the `accessionNumber` which should be unique for each filing.

SQL query examples
------------------

Find all filings for a ticker symbol:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM   "filings"
WHERE  "cikNumber" = (SELECT cikNumber FROM "tickers" WHERE "symbol" = "CCL")
```

Find all annual filings for a ticker symbol:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM   "filings"
WHERE  "cikNumber" = (SELECT cikNumber FROM "tickers" WHERE "symbol" = "CCL")
AND    "formType" = "10-K"
```

Find all filings with a given company name:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM   "filings"
WHERE  "companyName" LIKE "%CARNIVAL%"
```

Get all annual income statements for a ticker symbol:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "income_statement"
WHERE "duration" = 12
AND   "accessionNumber" IN (
	SELECT "accessionNumber"
	FROM   "filings"
	WHERE  "cikNumber" = (SELECT cikNumber FROM "tickers" WHERE symbol = "CCL")
	AND    "formType" = "10-K"
)
```

Get all quarterly income statements for a ticker symbol:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "income_statement"
WHERE "duration" = 3
AND   "accessionNumber" IN (
	SELECT "accessionNumber"
	FROM   "filings"
	WHERE  "cikNumber" = (SELECT "cikNumber" FROM "tickers" WHERE "symbol" = "CCL")
)
```

Get all the quarterly ratios (annualized most recent quarter):

AND   "accessionNumber" IN (
	SELECT "accessionNumber"
	FROM   "filings"
	WHERE  "cikNumber" = (SELECT "cikNumber" FROM "tickers" WHERE "symbol" = "CCL")
)
```

Get all the annual ratios (please note that for annual reports mrq and ttm doesnâ€™t really make sense. I still generate those rows in order to simplify the SQL query for the quarterly views):

```sql
SELECT * FROM "ratios"
WHERE "kind" = "mrq"
AND   "accessionNumber" IN (
	SELECT "accessionNumber"
	FROM   "filings"
	WHERE  "cikNumber" = (SELECT "cikNumber" FROM "tickers" WHERE "symbol" = "CCL")
	AND    "formType" = "10-K"
)
```

Ratios
------

The following formulas where used to calculate the ratios in the `ratios` table:

### Liquidity

Working Capital                = Current Assets - Current Liabilities  
Current Ratio                  = Current Assets / Current Liabilities  
Quick Ratio                    = (Cash&Equivalents + Short-term Investments + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities  
Cash Ratio                     = (Cash&Equivalents + Invested Funds) / Current Liabilities  

### Profitability
Gross Profit Margin            = Gross Profit / Revenues  
Operating Profit Margin        = Operating Income / Revenues  
Pretax Profit Margin           = Pretax Income / Revenues  
Net Income Margin              = Net Income / Revenues  
Effective Tax Rate             = Income Tax Expense / Pretax Income  

### Returns
Return on Sales                = Net Income / Revenues  
Return on Assets               = Net Income / Avg. Total Assets  
Return on Equity               = Net Income / Avg. Shareholders' Equity  
Return on Capital Employed     = EBIT / (Avg. Debt Liabilities + Avg. Shareholders' Equity)  

### Debt
Debt Ratio                     = Total Liabilities / Total Assets  
Debt-Equity Ratio              = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity  
Capitalization Ratio           = Total Debt / (Total Debt + Shareholders' Equity)  
Cash Flow-Debt Ratio           = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt  
Interest Coverage              = EBIT / Interest Expense  

### Operating Performance
Asset Turnover                 = Revenue / Avg. Total Assets  
Fixed Asset Turnover           = Revenue / Avg. Property&Plant&Equipment  
Receivables Turnover           = Revenue / Avg. Receivables  
Inventory Turnover             = Cost of Goods Sold / Avg. Inventory  

### Cash Flow
OCF/Sales                      = Operating Cash Flow / Revenues  
Free Cash Flow/OCF             = (Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditure) / Operating Cash Flow  
Short-term Debt Coverage       = Operating Cash Flow / Short-term Debt  
Capital Expenditure Coverage   = Operating Cash Flow / Capital Expenditure  
Dividend Coverage              = Operating Cash Flow / Dividend  
Free Cash Flow/OCF             = (Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditure) / Operating Cash Flow  
Short-term Debt Coverage       = Operating Cash Flow / Short-term Debt  
Capital Expenditure Coverage   = Operating Cash Flow / Capital Expenditure  
Dividend Coverage              = Operating Cash Flow / Dividend
